They were still playing tag and Alexander chased his friends into the woods, dodging and diving through the old, gnarled trees, and skimming the moss-covered logs. Suddenly, they came upon a clearing in the middle of the forest. There they saw a basket swing swaying in the breeze. The children jumped around in excitement and raced over to the swing. All of them got on and it started swinging automatically. They were having so much fun that they didn’t notice that the ground started to steadily open up.\n",

It was pitch black but then they saw a blue light shining below their feet. Rising and rising came the blue light and an ear-piercing screech filled their ears. It was a gigantic, slimy, blue monster ready to gobble them up. The monster had suckers on his tentacles like a Dyson hoover on a turbo setting. It gripped them at every angle and rapidly pulled them into his mega mouth. The children shrieked and wailed as their nightmare came alive and tormented their minds, but no one could hear their cries.\n",
